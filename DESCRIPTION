Description: PMLseg is a R package for the detection of change-points (segmentation) of univariate time series by Penalized Maximum Likelihood. The method detects changes in the mean superposed with a periodic signal (here modelled as a 4th order Fourier series) and IID noise with variance changing over fixed intervals. It was initially developed for the detection of change-points in daily climate data susperposed with an annually periodic bias and variance changing over monthly intervals \insertCite{Quarello2022}{@Quarello2022}. The package was first published under the name \code{GNSSseg} and applied to the segmentation of daily GNSS minus reanalysis Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) differences. Compared to \code{GNSSseg}, PMLseg has several bugs fixed and includes auxiliary functions for the screening, validation and visualization of the segmentation results.
